It's a simple web app built using REACT.js.

Ever went to a Restaurant with friends and there is one vegetarian guy who refuses to pay for the items he didn't eat and then splitting the bills get difficult. This apps does that for you while also keeping the tabs of the total bill.

I created it for myself, as I every now and then get into this kind of situation :sweat_smile:
